# csv_files_explained.py
"""
We call all files with a list of different values a
CSV file and then use different delimiters (like a
comma or tab) to indicate where the different values
start and stop.

Notice the \n character, this is the escape sequence
for a new line. The possibility of a new line escaped
by a \n character in our data is why we pass the
newline='' keyword argument to the open() function.

Notice that when we call csv.DictReader we pass in the
delimiter parameter, which is the string thatâ€™s used
to delineate separate fields in the CSV.
